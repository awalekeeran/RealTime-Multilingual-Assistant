# RealTime Multilingual Assistant

## Overview
Build a real-time virtual assistant that:

- Transcribes spoken queries (ASR).
- Understands and generates responses (LLM).
- Vocalizes responses in the customer's preferred language (TTS).
- Provides an interactive interface for real-time communication.

## Architecture Overview
> ### Components:
>  - **Azure Cognitive Services**:
>     - Speech-to-Text (ASR): Transcribes spoken input.
>     - Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts responses to speech in multiple languages.
>  - **Azure OpenAI Service (LLM)**:
>  Processes the query and generates a contextual response.
>  - **Frontend**:
>    - Blazor Server or ASP.NET Core MVC: For the user interface.
>    - SignalR: For real-time communication.
>  - **Backend**:
>    - ASP.NET Core Web API to manage interaction between ASR, LLM, and TTS.
